Task 02 â€“ Titanic: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Analysis
Analyze the influence of demographic, socio-economic, and voyage-related variables on passenger survival in the Titanic dataset.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Source: Kaggle Competition â€“ Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
Files used: train.csv and test.csv

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Data Cleaning

Impute missing values (e.g., Age, Cabin, Embarked)

Encode categorical variables (using Label or One-Hot Encoding)

Detect and treat outliers in features like Fare and Age

Exploratory Analysis

Assess survival patterns based on sex, passenger class, and age groups

Explore correlations between fare, embarkation point, and survival

Investigate the impact of family size (SibSp + Parch) on survival outcome

Visual Insights

Stacked bar charts for survival by Sex and Pclass

KDE and box plots to compare Fare distributions by survival status

Correlation heatmap to observe relationships among key features
